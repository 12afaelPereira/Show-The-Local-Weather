Show the local weather using OpenWeatherMap API.

### About

It was a FreeCodeCamp's [challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/take-home-projects/show-the-local-weather/). 

I've used [ipapi](https://ipapi.co/) and [openWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) api to get the location and the weather data from user, by using ajax request.
